# Rtools Packages [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/r-windows/rtools-packages?branch=master)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jeroen/rtools-packages)

A repository of pacman packages for use with the new experimental [rtools 4.0](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/testing/rtools40.html). Builds from the master branch are automatically deployed on [bintray](https://dl.bintray.com/rtools/) and become directly available in the `pacman` tool in Rtools 4.0.
